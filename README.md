# Gym Progress Tracker

## Description

**Gym Progress Tracker** is a mobile application developed as part of my bachelor's thesis in the BSc, Computer Science program at the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies. The application is designed to assist users in monitoring their progress in the gym through a digital journal, enabling them to log workouts and observe improvements over time.

This application features a comprehensive record system based on either the weight lifted or the total volume performed, providing users with accurate and motivating insights into their fitness progress. To enhance the user experience, the app includes illustrative images for exercises, allowing users to better understand the correct form and execution. 

Inter-page communication within the application is efficiently managed using **Intents**, ensuring smooth navigation between different sections. All components of the application, including layouts, user interface elements, and database communication, have been entirely developed within **Android Studio**, adhering to best practices for mobile development.
